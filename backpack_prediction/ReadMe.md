## Kaggle notebook

To see the kaggle notebook visit [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cmdhmn/just-wasting-time)

## Features

- Built using **scikit-learn** for machine learning.
- Visualization tools include **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data exploration.
- The analysis and model training are conducted in **JupyterLab**.

---

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- scikit-learn 1.0
- Matplotlib 3.4.3
- Seaborn 0.11.2
- JupyterLab 3.0.0

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [BackPack Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/playground-series-s5e2).

Or run the below command if u have kaggle install in you system

```bash
kaggle competitions download -c playground-series-s5e2
```

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cmd-HMN/practice_models.git
    cd backpack_prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Launch JupyterLab:

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

4. Open and run the desired notebook from notebooks like -> `s5e2.ipynb`
