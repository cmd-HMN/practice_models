## Overview

This project is a **House Prediction Model**. The primary goal of this project is to predict house pricing based on features given features.

---

You can also see the the [notebook on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cmdhmn/house-prediction-res-18000)

---

## Features

- Built using **scikit-learn** for machine learning.
- Visualization tools include **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data exploration.
- The analysis and model training are conducted in **JupyterLab**.

---

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- scikit-learn 1.0
- Matplotlib 3.4.3

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [House Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).

Or run the below command if u have kaggle install in you system

```bash
kaggle competitions download -c home-data-for-ml-course
```
